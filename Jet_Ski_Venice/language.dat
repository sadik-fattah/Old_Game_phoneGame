At the helm of a jet ski you can challenge time by playing the water in the Lagoon in Venice and enjoy the splendid panorama that this city only can offer.
Your aim is to reach the finishing line before the end of time allotted. Avoid  race course obstacles and collect the 'flash' bonus that increases your speed  for a short time. Each trampoline jump increases the time to reach the finishing line at your disposal.
Test your ability by reaching the finishing line at all three levels of difficulty (Easy, Normal, Hard) that can be selected from the 'Level' screenshot.
In the screenshot 'Hi-Score' all race statistics are registered as well as the higher score.
